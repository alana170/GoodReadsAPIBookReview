# project1

CS50 Harvard Web Programming with Python and Javascript Course

Date of Completion: 7/10/2020

In this project, I learned Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, SQL, accessing JSON files, and how to get data from an API. 
Using the GoodReads API, I made this website with user signup/login functionality, Books database, and Rating information. Clicking on the ISBN number for a book, gives you access to rating information for a particular book which was accessed through parsing a json file.
